                    <h1>WEB & APP TRACKING: <br> FROM STRATEGY TO TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS</h1>
                </header>
                <p>One of the most common project scopes I work with is to strategically and operationally support organizations to work data- and insight-driven with their websites and apps. From data collection strategy, data quality, data infrastructures, measurement plans and implementation of data collection tools.</p>

                    <h3>Getting started</h3>
                </header>
                <p>To get started with these type of projects I do a initial overhaul of current tracking, tool settings and compliance with privacy. I summarize my findings and potential improvements. I bring these findings to a meeting/workshop together with the customer with the purpose to understand the business needs and requirements. Together we define a measurement plan to match measurement points and KPIs with existing business goals and needs for future analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Based on the measurement plan we get a common understanding about what would be beneficial to track. I prepare an implementation of needed tracking scripts and dataLayers to match with the plan. I make sure there is a consistent tracking framework and data structure. I then collaborate with a developer to do the implementation on a test environment to see that everything work as expected, before we go ahead and deploy it to the live site or application. This step can take everything from a day to a couple of weeks of work depending on what type of company I am working for and how extensive the work is. <br> Data and Privacy regulations is always taken into consideration. </p>

                    <h3> <br> Maintenance and analysis</h3>
                </header>
                <p>This is where the real fun begins! Now when we are confident that we got an accurate datainflow that matches the organization needs we can start to continuously work with analysis, data insights and visualization. I am passionate about combining and transforming collected data into insights that can be used to optimize workflows and their outcomes, to make sure that collected data comes to the best use possible. <br> This type of work is not a one-time work effort, it is important to continuously develop this area to keep up with regulations, best practices and business needs to maintain a good quality. </p>
